# RWA-Impact-Analysis-Capital-One Basel III vs. Basel III Endgame Proposal

#### Objective

The project evaluates the impact of the Basel III Endgame Proposal on Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) for Credit, Market, Operational, and CVA risks for Capital One. Using regulatory reports, this study quantifies the changes in RWA and highlights areas of increased stringency under the proposed framework.

#### Methodology
1.Data Sources:

* Regulatory Reports: FR Y-9C, FFIEC 102, and FR Y-14 were leveraged for comprehensive RWA calculations.

*Historical and current RWA figures were extracted and processed for comparative analysis.
#### Basel III Framework:

Baseline RWAs for Credit, Market, Operational, and CVA risks were computed under the existing Basel III framework.
Calculations adhered to standardized approaches and risk categorization.
Basel III Endgame Proposal:

Proposed modifications were applied to the same datasets to evaluate changes in RWAs.
Changes in risk weightings, capital requirements, and exposure calculations were incorporated.
#### Impact Analysis:

The percentage increase in RWA across various risk categories was computed.
Trends and drivers of RWA changes were identified, emphasizing stricter requirements.
#### Key Results
#### Overall RWA Increase:

The Basel III Endgame Proposal led to a notable rise in total RWA for Capital One.
Breakdown of Increases:

Credit RWA: Increased by +10.93%, driven by stricter capital requirements for certain exposures.
Market RWA: Rose significantly by +44%, reflecting changes in the Standardized Approach for market risk.
Operational RWA: Increased by +7.36%, primarily due to enhanced operational risk standards.
Conclusion
This project highlights the substantial impact of the Basel III Endgame Proposal on financial institutions. The increased RWA requirements indicate a need for banks to re-evaluate their capital allocation strategies and risk management frameworks. For Capital One, the rise in RWAs underscores the importance of compliance and strategic adjustments in response to regulatory changes.

Future Work
Extend the analysis to include additional banks for broader industry insights.
Perform scenario analysis and stress testing under the proposed framework.
Evaluate the economic implications of the Basel III Endgame Proposal on profitability and growth.
